# 2025 FPGA Midterm Exercise (Ten Point Half)

* FPGA: xc7a35tcsg324-1 (DSPs 90)
* Vivado 2024.2

A functioning Verilog code for an easy game of ten-point half using an FPGA board.

Ten-point-half is a kind of poker card game. There are two characters in this game. One is the dealer and the other is the player. The players aim to get larger values of cards in total than the dealer to win the game. In contrast, the dealer gets higher values than the players to win. The only restriction is that both players and the dealer canâ€™t have their cards greater than 10.5 in total.
